# p5.js Template P

Template project for creating [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches using the following tools:

- Code editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Other tools: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

See also [other templates](https://fal-works.github.io/p5js-templates/).


## Usage

1. Install the two below if not yet installed:

   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Create your project folder by copying this template, then open it with VS Code.

3. Install the VS Code extension:

   - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)  
   (from CLI: `code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode`)

    Now Prettier works automatically every time you save your code.

4. Feel free to edit `script.js`.

5. Open `index.html` to see the result.


## If you're curious

The VS Code extension for Prettier includes its own bundled version of Prettier (see also the Readme of the extension), which is why this template works without having any npm dependencies.
